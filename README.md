# pylifxtiles

Special thanks to everyone who's contributed to the LIFXLAN library of which 
the majority of this library is built upon. Without their work none of this
would be possible.

## Purpose

This library was created specifically for the purposes of displaying and manipulating
content on the Tiles product created by LIFX 

https://geni.us/HKGLifxTiles

Note: Affiliates link. I may get a small amount if you chose to purchase through this link.

Functions include
- Writing letters and numbers to tiles
- Writing specific objects to tiles
- Moving content around on tiles ( rotate, shift )
- Convert jpg/png images to tiles

## Examples

Please look in the *examples* directory for example usages of the library.
Some examples, such as the Youtube Sub count project may require external API access
and appropriate credentials. Setting those up is outside the scope of 
this project.
